# New Project Proposal Template

Proposing a new [Project](/Rules/projects) starts with this New Project Template. This is an opportunity to clearly define the Project outcomes, scope, timeline, budget, payout schema, attentional budget, problems, win state and more.

This Template is reviewed by the DAO and approved or denied. If approved, template becomes the contract that the DAO uses to hold the Project accountable.

### Components of a Project

- Client (DAO Masons for Internal Project, other for External Project)
- Submitted By (often the Project Lead)
- Project Lead (Responsible for managing the project, see description below)
- Initial Role Structure (A set of roles with purpose & accountabilities that, if filled would result in a functioning team capable of achieving the stated outcomes)
- Team (Each individual who will initially be supporting the project and filling roles)
- Outcomes (1 or more distinct verifiable end results for the project)
- Ongoing Processes (Repeating events such as meetings, code deployment, tweets etc.)
- Estimated end date
- Due date (or review date for ongoing projects)
- Brief Analysis of the project
- Some sort of project DAO mechanism to track progress and give fair compensation to the team (usually this will be [Ritual of Light](/Rituals/ritual-of-sacrifice.md)
- Payment method (ex. Smart Invoice)
- Clients preferred network for payments (try to use the same network as DAO Masons Core DAO to avoid fees and transit risks)

Answer these questions: 

* What problem does this project solve?
* What is the "Win State" available at the end of this project? 
* What would be the major impact of **not** doing this project?
* What could go wrong? What is the "Lose State"?
* How does your proposal uniquely move us toward the Win State and avoid the Lose State?

For each outcome:
* What are the major deliverables?
* How will we know that this outcome has been achieved?
* What benefit do we expect from achieving this outcome? 

For each ongoing process:
* What is the ongoing process?
* How often does it happen, and what happens?
* Is it possible this ongoing process will continue after this project ends? If so why?




## Ongoing Operations

Projects have 2 main parts: Outcomes and Ongoing Operations. 

Examples of ongoing operations include:

- Preparing agenda before each meeting
- Taking notes during meetings
- Routing DAO funds or managing the treasury
- Ongoing client relations and acquisitions
- Content with a set release schedule, like a podcast.

### Components of an Ongoing Operation

- Project Lead
- Team
- Work involved
- Estimate of time spent each period (week or month) (and the expected amount billed to DAO Masons)
- Expected output each period (week or month)
- Payout interval (weekly, monthly, etc)
- Review Date
- Brief Analysis of the operation
- Usually some sort of role, and a way for other DAO members to leave feedback on the operation.
- Some sort of project DAO mechanism to track progress and give fair compensation to the team (usually this will be [Ritual of Light](/Rituals/ritual-of-sacrifice.md)

## How to create a Project

1. Create a [Project Request](/Templates/project-proposal) and add it to the Discussion Forum.
2. The item will be added to the meeting agenda.
3. DAO Masons Core Members discuss the project request, and decide whether or not to submit the proposal to the DAO. This can happen at any stage of the meeting decision making [process](/Rules/decision-making).
4. Execution of the Moloch Proposal will create a new project DAO for the team to work within. (Currently this process is done manually)

## 1st Phase:

**Submitted By:** Jord

**Suggested Lead:** Jord

**Customer:** DAO Masons

### What problem does this project solve?

- **Lack of Focus:** Setting up a dedicated project allows us to focus on tasks that are immediatley relevant in priority that gets us the greatest benefit. It also ensures that we're working together towards a shared goal.
- **Lack of Economy:** While free form building may be good for exploration and overall enjoyment. Most in the DAO need to start earning yesterday. Using a focused project approach to building the DAO allows us to maximize the value we get out of every minute that we work for free.
- **Cold Start Problem:** It would be perfect if we could paid to build our portfolio. Unfortunately, we're a deep niche in a troubled market. Most customers would not understand the value of what we're offering until we show them. Which means that we need to build an app to show them the value that we can provide.
- **Momentum** There's a large push that's needed to start a DAO and put some energy behind our efforts. We need to see daily reminders of our progress and commitments to keep the motivation high. This project format is good for that.

### What are the major deliverables

- **The Game Design Doc**: Documented social coordination mechanisms that are easy to read and are easy to use.
- **The Brand**: A basic design that people in space will easily recognize
- **The App**: An app that we use to coordinate, that also works as a show room model to attract customers. This app is also our landing page. Needs to shine. Needs attention to detail.
- ~~**An outlet**: A place for us to place our thoughts. Could be a custom blog or posted on an existing platform or both. (Optional: discuss)~~
- **Some Tools:** All the basic DAO coordination tools we need to get started. A minimal but organized discord with roles, a place to organize our projects. (what is MVP here?)

### Win State:

All the above initiatives have a simple, basic implementation that performs their function well.

By the end of this project we should have a good idea of how this DAO works and how we coordinate. We have all the basic tools we need to support ourselves and we have demonstrated that we can build a great DAO (both technically and socially) to clients.

We measure success by comparing our goals before embarking on this journey and seeing how many of these goals we hit. Also, I want to hear some 'ooos' and 'aaahs' when people see our app.

### Lose State

**What is the major impact of not doing this project**

We lose interest and stop building because we're not going in any particular direction. Another DAO lost to coordination entropy.

Futhermore, we fail to demonstrate our own expertise in building a focused, streamlined DAO. Something that we are all interested in building.

**What can go wrong?**

- We go in the wrong direction. We spend too much time building stuff without customers. This is why it's important to have 'the hunt' initiative to coincide with this project.
- No one wants a DAO. Not really in our control. I'd rather know for sure that people don't want a DAO, by building a great example and having them turn us down, then assuming that no one will ever want a DAO.
- All of our assumptions about building lean, focused DAOs with defined rules are wrong and we make asses of ourselves in public. This is possible. But I'd rather find out that we were wrong than not do it and never know. Or worse, we're right but never do it, and another team with the courage to take on the mission does it while we watch.

## 2nd phase:

Timeline: Jan 6th - Feb 22nd (47 Days)

Lead: Jord

Roles Required (Team):

- Lead/Product Manager/Dev
- Dev/Design
- Project Manager/Copy Editing
- Comms/Community/Oddjobs

Budget & Labour:

Total DAO labour assumptions

UI: 3 hrs/day, weekends off
Boiler: 2hrs/day, every day
Rowdy: 2.5hrs/day, weekends off

UI: 31 days x 3hrs = 93hrs
Boiler: 47 days x 2hrs = 92hrs
Rowdy: 31 days x 2.5hrs = 77.5hrs
Jord: 39 days x 4hrs = = 156hrs

Total DAO labor commitments until EthDenver: 418.5

We agreed in the meeting following the first phase that ideally, this project would use 50% of the DAO's focus. Therefore our total estimated labour for this project is 209.25 hrs

Target Budget: 210 shares
