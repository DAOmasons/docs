**Brief Analysis of the Project:**
This project aims to promote our DAO's services to other DAOs, increase brand awareness, and establish partnerships. By targeting other DAOs as potential clients, we can leverage their resources and networks to expand our reach and impact within the ecosystem.

**Payment Method:** Shares via DAO disperse

**Client's Preferred Network for Payments:** Arbitrum

## Questions to Answer:

1. **What problem does this project solve?**

   - We are facing the "cold start problem" where we need to build visibility, reputation & reliability so that we can secure clients who trust us enough to pay us and entrust us with important work.

2. **What is the "Win State" available at the end of this project?**

   - The "Win State" is gaining the opportunity to secure a win for another DAO.
   - The larger Arbitrum community recognizes DAO Masons as a reliable partner to DAOs.

3. **What would be the major impact of not doing this project?**

   - The major impact of not doing this project would be missing out on potential growth opportunities, limiting our DAO's reach within the ecosystem, and potentially stagnating our progress.

4. **What could go wrong? What is the "Lose State"?**

   - We get a client and then don't have the bandwidth to sustain our community presence or deliver on promises
   - We could lose momentum, get discouraged or get distracted and end up wasting our time
   - We fail to resonate with other DAOs, leading to a lack of interest and engagement.

5. **How does your proposal uniquely move us toward the Win State and avoid the Lose State?**

   - An emphasis on research and strategy design means we'll be working to solve real problems and providing tangible value
   - We are measuring meaningful interactions and emphasizing outreach & communication, which makes it likely we'll gain positive attention and be seen as a reliable source for DAOs within the larger Arbitrum community.
   - Breaking the work into discrete roles makes it less overwhelming to any individual, and granular roles can be handed off to others if we need to reassign people to client work
   - Weekly strategy & review meeting will be measuring meaningful interactions, which should create a reward cycle for us to improve motivation

## For Each Outcome:

1. **What are the major deliverables?**

   1. Increase DAO Masons visibility
      - 1000 meaningful interactions
      - Forum post responses, references, likes, mentions
   2. Establish partnerships with at least three other DAOs

   - 5 meetings/conversations with potential clients

   - Close on one paid deal

   - Increased brand awareness and engagement among larger DAOs
   - Partnerships established with at least three larger DAOs
   - Improved conversion rates

3 **What benefit do we expect from achieving this outcome?**

## For each ongoing process:

1. **What is the ongoing process?**

2. **How often does it happen, and what happens?**

3. **Is it possible this ongoing process will continue after this project ends? If so why?**
