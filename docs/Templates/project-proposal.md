**Brief Analysis of the Project:**
This project aims to promote our DAO's services to other DAOs, increase brand awareness, and establish partnerships. By targeting other DAOs as potential clients, we can leverage their resources and networks to expand our reach and impact within the ecosystem.

**DAO Mechanism to Track Progress and Give Fair Compensation to the Team:** Ritual of Light

**Payment Method:** Shares via DAO disperse

**Client's Preferred Network for Payments:** Arbitrum

## Questions to Answer:

1. **What problem does this project solve?**

   - We are facing the "cold start problem" where we need to build visibility, reputation & reliability so that we can secure clients who trust us enough to pay us and entrust us with important work.

2. **What is the "Win State" available at the end of this project?**

   - The "Win State" is gaining the opportunity to secure a win for another DAO.
   - The larger Arbitrum community recognizes DAO Masons as a reliable partner to DAOs.

3. **What would be the major impact of not doing this project?**

   - The major impact of not doing this project would be missing out on potential growth opportunities, limiting our DAO's reach within the ecosystem, and potentially stagnating our progress.

4. **What could go wrong? What is the "Lose State"?**

   - We get a client and then don't have the bandwidth to sustain our community presence or deliver on promises
   - We could lose momentum, get discouraged or get distracted and end up wasting our time
   - We fail to resonate with other DAOs, leading to a lack of interest and engagement.

5. **How does your proposal uniquely move us toward the Win State and avoid the Lose State?**

   - An emphasis on research and strategy design means we'll be working to solve real problems and providing tangible value
   - We are measuring meaningful interactions and emphasizing outreach & communication, which makes it likely we'll gain positive attention and be seen as a reliable source for DAOs within the larger Arbitrum community.
   - Breaking the work into discrete roles makes it less overwhelming to any individual, and granular roles can be handed off to others if we need to reassign people to client work
   - Weekly strategy & review meeting will be measuring meaningful interactions, which should create a reward cycle for us to improve motivation

# How to Start a New DAO Masons Project

1. **Read** the [Project Overview](../Rules/projects) rules page.
1. **Create** a Project Request using the template below. 
1. **Add** it to the Discussion Forum.
1. **Attend** a DAO Masons meeting and add your project to the agenda. 
1. **Use** the [Decision Making Process](/docs/Rules/decision-making) with DAO Masons Core Members to decide whether or not to initiate an on-chain DAO vote for the proposal.

If a proposal is created and passes, a new project DAO is created for the team to work within and work begins. (Currently this process is done manually)
