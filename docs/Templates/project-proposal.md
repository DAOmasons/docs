## New Projects

Any member of the DAO can propose a new Project.  

There are 2 main types of Projects: Internal and External

All projects must define 1 or more **Project Outcomes**. An Outcome is defined in a way that makes it clear when it is complete, so projects naturally end when they've achieved all of their defined Outcomes. Projects can also be ended prematurely if the Outcome is deemed unnecessary or infeasible for some reason.

Projects may define **Recurring Processes** - actions that are expected to be repeated again and again during the lifespan of the Project.

**Internal projects** are designed to improve some aspect of DAO Masons itself. Examples: Set up a CRM, Generate & Publish internal Rulebook.

**External projects** are designed to provide service to an external entity according to external specifications. Examples: Launch a DAO-backed web site that lets Org A track user contributions. 


### Proposing a new Project

Proposing a new PRoject starts with the New Project Template.  This is an opportunity to clearly define the Project Outcomes, scope, timeline, monetary budget, attentional budget, problems, win state and more. 

This Template is reviewed by the DAO and approved or denied. If approved, template becomes the contract that the DAO uses to hold the Project accountable. 

Rituals: The Why, followed by the Mechanics


## 1st Phase:

**Submitted By:** Jord

**Suggested Lead:** Jord

**Customer:** DAO Masons

### What problem does this project solve?

- **Lack of Focus:** Setting up a dedicated project allows us to focus on tasks that are immediatley relevant in priority that gets us the greatest benefit. It also ensures that we're working together towards a shared goal.
- **Lack of Economy:** While free form building may be good for exploration and overall enjoyment. Most in the DAO need to start earning yesterday. Using a focused project approach to building the DAO allows us to maximize the value we get out of every minute that we work for free.
- **Cold Start Problem:** It would be perfect if we could paid to build our portfolio. Unfortunately, we're a deep niche in a troubled market. Most customers would not understand the value of what we're offering until we show them. Which means that we need to build an app to show them the value that we can provide.
- **Momentum** There's a large push that's needed to start a DAO and put some energy behind our efforts. We need to see daily reminders of our progress and commitments to keep the motivation high. This project format is good for that.

### What are the major deliverables

- **The Game Design Doc**: Documented social coordination mechanisms that are easy to read and are easy to use.
- **The Brand**: A basic design that people in space will easily recognize
- **The App**: An app that we use to coordinate, that also works as a show room model to attract customers. This app is also our landing page. Needs to shine. Needs attention to detail.
- ~~**An outlet**: A place for us to place our thoughts. Could be a custom blog or posted on an existing platform or both. (Optional: discuss)~~
- **Some Tools:** All the basic DAO coordination tools we need to get started. A minimal but organized discord with roles, a place to organize our projects. (what is MVP here?)

### Win State:

All the above initiatives have a simple, basic implementation that performs their function well.

By the end of this project we should have a good idea of how this DAO works and how we coordinate. We have all the basic tools we need to support ourselves and we have demonstrated that we can build a great DAO (both technically and socially) to clients.

We measure success by comparing our goals before embarking on this journey and seeing how many of these goals we hit. Also, I want to hear some 'ooos' and 'aaahs' when people see our app.

### Lose State

**What is the major impact of not doing this project**

We lose interest and stop building because we're not going in any particular direction. Another DAO lost to coordination entropy.

Futhermore, we fail to demonstrate our own expertise in building a focused, streamlined DAO. Something that we are all interested in building.

**What can go wrong?**

- We go in the wrong direction. We spend too much time building stuff without customers. This is why it's important to have 'the hunt' initiative to coincide with this project.
- No one wants a DAO. Not really in our control. I'd rather know for sure that people don't want a DAO, by building a great example and having them turn us down, then assuming that no one will ever want a DAO.
- All of our assumptions about building lean, focused DAOs with defined rules are wrong and we make asses of ourselves in public. This is possible. But I'd rather find out that we were wrong than not do it and never know. Or worse, we're right but never do it, and another team with the courage to take on the mission does it while we watch.

## 2nd phase:

Timeline: Jan 6th - Feb 22nd (47 Days)

Lead: Jord

Roles Required (Team):

- Lead/Product Manager/Dev
- Dev/Design
- Project Manager/Copy Editing
- Comms/Community/Oddjobs

Budget & Labour:

Total DAO labour assumptions

UI: 3 hrs/day, weekends off
Boiler: 2hrs/day, every day
Rowdy: 2.5hrs/day, weekends off
Jord: 4hrs/day, one day off (could be more if need be).

UI: 31 days x 3hrs = 93hrs
Boiler: 47 days x 2hrs = 92hrs
Rowdy: 31 days x 2.5hrs = 77.5hrs
Jord: 39 days x 4hrs = = 156hrs

Total DAO labor commitments until EthDenver: 418.5

We agreed in the meeting following the first phase that ideally, this project would use 50% of the DAO's focus. Therefore our total estimated labour for this project is 209.25 hrs

Target Budget: 210 shares

Breakdown of tasks:

Game Design Doc (50hrs):

    - DAO cultural norms (Summary of the manifesto)
