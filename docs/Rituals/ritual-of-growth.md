# Ritual of Growth

I've been riffing on a potential feedback loop mechanism that we can use to help make sense of our services/product strategy.

Without a clear strategy, and knowing why do both products and services, we may end up getting too distracted to do either well.

However, if implemented well, we might be able to create a flywheel effect where our products and services each serve a common output, growth.

My rough thinking around this flywheel effect would be:

We solve novel problems for customers with services (novel solutions)
=> we refactor those novel solutions into reusable products
=> those products help us build a base of notoriety and revenue
=> which we use to attract more customers
=> who we help solve novel problems for with our services.

and so on...
