## Essence

Ritual of Light is a proportional compensation system for projects.

It requires that a team meet together at a regular interval and make claims based on work completed. Everyone who is making a claim specifies the amount of time they have worked, and (optionally) a value level for the work. _If the team does decide to use value levels, they assign values based on a team rubric that was defined before the project started._

Every claim earns shares in a Project DAO, which acts a ledger of past contributions. Once the project is complete and the team has decided to close the project, the amount of tokens that the team has earned is sent to the Project DAO and the team pulls their funds.

## Why?

After trying this system ourselves, we found that it felt like we were finally _'working with the lights on'_ as it suddenly became clear how much work we were doing and how much value we were adding. Thus the name, Ritual of Light.

Tracking contributions in DAOs is extremely difficult because there is usually no 'boss' with final authority to decide who is adding what amount of value. What we needed was a contribution tracker where the rewards were proportional to the amount each worker has put in. More than that, we need a system that is fluid, low-overhead, and doesn't get in the way of the team's work. And since being 'fluid' demanded that we had to design a system that was 'trustful', we needed to add some checks and balances.

#### What problems are we solving

The main problem we are solving is the opacity of DAO contributions

- Most organizations work in the dark (not just DAOs).
- They have very low visibility into how much work is being done and how much value is being added.
- Bosses with final authority assign value based on what a HR department says is the going rate for a given job.
- Or in DAOs, where there is no ultimate authority, the value of work is assigned by the team itself. This can cause problems because:
  - Sometimes team members are afraid to speak up if they feel they are being underpaid or another contributor is being overpaid.
  - The remote aspect of DAO work makes it really hard to tell who is doing the work.
  - It is often the case that the team is not aware of the amount of work that has been done by a contributor.
  - Estimates are good, but due to the unpredictable nature of working in a rapidly evolving space makes it difficult to fetch accurate estimates based purely on value added (at least within a project).
  - Some systems do try to assign a value to a task (bounty board), but this is high overhead and is sometimes subject to the same arbitrary value assignment problems as the traditional system (at least within a project).
- Clients are often not aware of how much work is being done and the ongoing progress of a project they are paying for. Wouldn't it be nice if they could see the progress of a project in real time?
- Projects that reward contributors based strictly on a 'value added' sense don't have a clear way to track overall time spent, which makes it difficult to calculate future estimates for similar projects.

#### Why is this a good solution?

Ritual of Light solves this problem by:

- Making the team aware of how much time
