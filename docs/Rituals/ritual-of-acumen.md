# Ritual of Acumen

##### Current Stage of Development

- [x] Unimplemented
- [ ] Manual
- [ ] Systemetized
- [ ] Partially Automated
- [ ] Fully Automated/Passive

## Essence

This is a system for testing the acumen of potential core members. It is a test of their ability to think critically and communicate effectively. It is also a test of their ability to work with others. This will be a verbal test where Core Members verify has studied the required content (DAO rules/processes, mission/values, meeting etiquette, and basic critical thinking skills).

## Why?

The Ritual of Acumen serves to safe-guard the Core DAO decision making process by ensuring that Core Members are aware about the DAO and its systems, able to think critically and communicate effectively.

#### What problems are we solving

- Having to re-explain the structure of the DAO in meetings when we should be making decisions.
- Having to rehash old debates when we have a regimented process for making decisions and changing rules.
- Logical fallacies and poor reasoning affecting our decisions
- Poor communication causing confusion and wasted time.

#### Why is this a good solution

- We create a common 'bedrock of understanding' among all members who hold governance positions. This way we can focus on the task at hand during discussions.
- We create a common language and set of tools for making decisions.
- Saving time not having to re-explain or rehash old debates, if we want to change rules, we have a formalized process for doing so.
- We can make decisions faster and more effectively.
- We can make better decisions by exposing ourselves to less risk of logical fallacies and poor reasoning.

#### Downsides/Risks

- Overhead/friction to onboarding new members.
- Overhead/friction for those who have to test new members.
- Thought Might become too homogenous if we take critical thinking too far. We do need some diversity of thought to allow for creativity.
- Also, pointing logical fallacy can be used as a way to discount reasonable arguments.

#### Mitigation:

To a certain degree, friction on the part of the member is a feature not a bug, so long as the rules are transparent, all the necessary support is provided, and the process is not too onerous.

For friction on part of the members, we can mitigate through automation over time. However, seeing as this DAO is designed to have a relatively small amount of Core Members, this should does not need to scale perfectly.

As for homogenous thought, we need to emphasize that critical thinking is a toolbox, not a religion. We also need to stress that part and parcel to critical thinking is a willingness to change and challenge your mind, which includes breaking away from groupthink.

## Current Implementation

Not Implemented.

## Roadmap

#### Next Step

Manual:

Create the starting docs for this test. We need to document the tactical meeting format, make sure our docs are consistent, and have some very concise documents about the basics of critical thinking.

Systemetized

Then we can feed these documents into ChatGPT and have it generate a log list of questions. We store those questions privately and then provide a randomized list of questions to the new member.

We will test this system on ourselves first.

#### Endgame

Hard to tell what items we can fully automate. This is a system that definitely requires feedback from the Core Members.

Automation is risky because we don't want to create a system that is too easy to game. We should have humans present to verify that the new member is actually studying the material.

## Details

(none yet. Add resources for testing here.)
