### Quest Roles

Follows mostly the same conventions as the project roles. It can be built into the rep system that in order to recieve the NFT at the completion of the quest, they must hold the role. More on that next.

## Reputation and Roles

As projects complete and reputation tokens in the form of SBTs are assigned, within the metadata can include assigned weights for reputation. This can very based on role played. For example someone may have wrote a tweet thread promoting the project, For this they may get something like 1 reputation point for the project and a project promoter SBT, with that point in the metadata.
Somebodey that has made a substantial contribution to the project, such as Main Solidity Dev, may get 10 reputation points assigned to them.
Every role may have some pre determined reputation attached to it as well. Example, in the described "Community Roles" somebody that attains the "100 Posts" role may recieve an SBT corresponding to the aquired role with 1 reputation point.
