# Ritual of Echoes

##### Current Stage of Development

- [ ] Unimplemented
- [x] Manual
- [ ] Systemetized
- [ ] Partially Automated
- [ ] Fully Automated/Passive

## Essence

Ritual of echoes is a mechanism for rewarding contributors for past contributions made to DAO Masons. Every the DAO earns revenue, we:

- Bring a predetermined amount of funds to the DAO
- Of that amount, we allocate predetermined percentage to the DAO treasury and the rest to the Echo Fund.
- The echo fund splits funds that are sent to it in proportion to each of share/non-voting share member.
- The amount that each member receives is determined by the amount of shares (and non-voting shares)they have in the Core masons DAO.
- Core Members earn shares by contributing to internal DAO projects.
- Contributors earn non-voting shares by contributing to internal DAO projects.
- 1 share generally equals on hour of work.

## Why?

- We need a way to incentivize people to build and maintain DAO Masons
- We need a way to reward people for past contributions
- Payment for services is intermittent and unpredictable, so we need a way for members to earn passive income during the times they are not working on an external project.

#### What problems are we solving

- Tragedy of the commons for goods within DAO Masons.
- Unsteady and unpredictable income for service DAO members.

#### Why is this a good solution

- If the DAO is generating revenue, it provides small amounts of passive income for everyone who has contributed in the past.
- The proportions of funds received is proportional to the amount of work that each member has contributed.
- Shares are diluted over time, as more and more contributions are made, ensuring that we're not just rewarding people who were here early. No matter what, we are rewarding people for how much time they have contributed to building up DAO Masons.
- Allows DAO members to choose their own levels of contribution.

#### Downsides/Risks

- Technical overhead. This will need to integrate with how our DAOs choose to handle payments from clients and revenue generated from
