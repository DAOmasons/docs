# DAO Masons Sustainability

## Goals

- Generate revenue to sustain and secure the DAO
- Entice and retain skilled talent
- Reward contributions to the Core DAO through retroactive rewards (see [Ritual of Echos](/Rituals/ritual-of-echos))
- Provide a fair and transparent system for rewarding contributions on projects (see [Ritual of Light](/Rituals/ritual-of-light))
- Provide meaningful value to the DAO ecosystem

## Income Streams

### Services

In the beginning, DAO Masons will focus primarily on services. This will allow us to generate revenue and build a reputation for high quality output within the ecosystem. It will also allow us to build a team of talented builders with a deep understanding of the space.

Our services will be focused on the following areas:

- DAO Design
- DAO Documentation and Audits
- DAO Development
- DAO Admin and Operations
- DAO Training
- Mediation and Conflict Resolution (discuss)
- Consulting in other aligned disciplines
- Any other service that would provide value to a decentralized community

DAO Masons earns a small percentage of all services we provide (10%). Of that small percentage, some will be sent directly to the treasury (5%), and the rest (5%) will be used to reward past contributions through the Echo Fund.

### Core Knowledge Base

From our experience working with DAOs, we will identify a number of common problems that are faced by many DAOs. Part of our work in services will be to document these problems and solutions.

At this stage, we do not want to decide too early how this store of knowledge will be monetized (or if it will be monetized at all), but a few potential options are:

- DAO specific content (e.g. a Podcast, newsletter, etc.) that is either sponsored or available to subscribers.
- Open DAO training and credentials. While we offer training as a service to other organizations, there may also be opportunities to offer education to the public.

As with most content strategies, it may be more effective to offer all of our content for free instead of direct monetization. This will allow us to build a reputation and a following, which will make it easier to attract more customers for services. This is more in line with the open nature of DAOs, but ultimately we need to decide once we have a core knowledge base.

The largest benefit of having a core knowledge basis is how it will help us make informed decisions when designing DAO Masons products.

### DAO Masons Products

As we work with DAOs, we will identify common problems that are faced by many DAOs. We will then build products that solve these problems. While the code for these products will be FOSS, these products should aim generate revenue through fees, subscriptions, or revenue split mechanisms.

DAO Masons may choose to build these products in-house, by offering direct funding or shares to the product team. In turn DAO Masons will receive a percentage of the revenue generated by the product.

DAO Masons is open to building products in collaboration with other DAOs. Discussions around revenue would need to be decided on a case-by-case basis.

Any revenue generated by DAO Masons products will be split between the DAO treasury and the Echo Fund.

## Rewarding Past Contributions

Most DAOs are not fully automated and require a team of committed contributors and members to build out the infrastructure, maintain the systems, and provide support to the community.

To incentivize continuing contributions, DAO Masons utilizes a recurring retroactive reward system to pay past contributors for work they've done in the past. This system is called the [Ritual of Echos](/Rituals/ritual-of-echos).

All revenues generated by any project in DAO Masons is split between the DAO treasury and the Echo Fund. The Echo fund splits all revenues sent to it based on the amount of Voting and Non-Voting shares in the Core DAO.

This means that every past contributor receives a small share of revenue every time the DAO receives income. DAO contributors are rewarded in proportion to their past contributions.

The only way to get exposure to the Echo Fund is to contribute to the Core DAO. Both Core Members and Contributors are able to make contributions to the Core DAO.

It is hard to earn a steady income when providing services, so the Echo Fund provides an opportunity to earn passive income in between projects.
