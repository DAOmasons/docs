# The New Builders

Itâ€™s time for a new class of builders to emerge. We already have the tools. We know how to put the walls together. Now we can make them custom fit for communities. Masters will teach apprentices how to build until they can apply their trade freely as journeymen, only to reinvent the trade, become masters themselves and teach their learnings to new apprentices. These builders will facilitate the creation of countless new communities and spark a new economy.

We are the DAO Masons. We believe working together from a baseline of inspiration and safety is our birthright as human beings. We envision a world where the fundamentals of human coordination are taught to children. We envision a world with viable alternatives to coercive power structures.
