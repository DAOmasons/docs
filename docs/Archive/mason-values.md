# DAO Mason Values

## Support Sovereign Communities

<p>
📕 A DAO Mason builds and services structures that offer sovereign communities the protection, stability, and freedom to coordinate.

</p>

<p>
🏰 Just as the fortress offered protection and stability to ancient community, we build DAO structures that provide structure and order for modern organizations.

</p>

## Productive, Disciplined, Sacrificing

<p>
📕 A DAO Mason is productive and disciplined. Voluntary, coordinated sacrifice for virtuous ideals is the blade we use to sever the head of Moloch.
</p>

<p>
⚔️ Our clients entrust us with their money, their businesses, and their livelihoods. When we mess up, miss a deadline, or slow down, it matters. We take that responsibility seriously.

</p>

## Dedication, Focus, Craft

<p>
⚔️ A DAO Mason cultivates a culture of craft, and craft is sacred. Dedication and focus are the rituals we perform to conjure expertise.
</p>

<p>
⚔️ We are each craftsmen with unique specialties and skills.  By working each day to approach mastery of our crafts, we become more effective as allies and colleagues.
</p>
