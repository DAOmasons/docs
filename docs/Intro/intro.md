# DAO Masons

DAO Masons are a collective of builders dedicated to helping other DAOs coordinate. We craft the tools, processes, and systems that DAOs need to achieve their goals.

## What We Offer

### Design

We design functional DAOs that help communities make decisions, coordinate, and grow. We gather input from the community and help them define their mission, vision, and values. Then we build the mechanisms that make it possible.

### Development

DAOs are unique. By crafting custom DAO applications and tools, we are able to let the community focus on what matters most: the mission.

### Education

In order for governance to be accessible to all members, they need know what game they are playing, and how to play it well. We provide workshops and cohorts to turn every member into a power-user.

### Products

Some problems are common to many DAOs. Our goal is to maximize the value we create for the ecosystem by refactoring our custom service solutions into scalable, modular products.

 ### Why Now?

It falls on us to challenge old assumptions and become new engineers of human coordination systems. We do this for ourselves, our families, communities and the greater society. We do this by pursuing mastery over the fundamental mechanics of the new basic unit of human coordination: The DAO.

As happened in the middle ages, our current world order is crumbling. Our leaders and the systems they energize – once relied upon as incorruptible bastions of truth, honor, service and authority – have become corrupted and are no longer trustworthy as a whole. What was originally designed to serve the people and provide each with resources and opportunity, has been bent over time to serve more siloed agendas.

The source, causes and nature of this corruption are beyond the scope of this document. The corruption itself is apparent and assumed. Our purpose is to provide a counterbalance to this corruption.

If you continue reading and find yourself aligned with the mission of the DAO Masons, we look forward to hearing your views, opinions and reasoned conclusions on this worthy topic. -->
