# Join DAO Masons

DAO Masons is looking for high motivated, passionate DAO builders to join our ranks. We have two distinct paths for contributors to work with DAO Masons:

### Contributors:

The contributor track is a **low-friction track**, designed to get hard-working, talented builders working on DAO Masons projects as fast as possible. It is also for those who would like to one day become a core member and are looking to demonstrate their skills and commitment to DAO Masons.

The key distinction between contributors and core members is that contributors are not committed to full-time DAO Masons governance. There are no limitations on earnings or how many projects a contributor can work on.

If you wish to begin working at DAO Masons, please join our Discord and introduce yourself in the #introductions channel.We will then invite you to our contributor channel where you can begin working on projects.

### Core Members:

Governance requires frequent, consistent, and dedicated participation. The Core Member track is designed for those who are committed and determined to make DAO Masons as successful as possible.

In order to meet the demands of DAO governance (which are frequently underestimated), the Core Member track is designed to be **high-friction**. We want to filter in those who are willing to take on the responsibilities and challenges of DAO governance. Not only must you be a talented builder, but you must also be a talented communicator, critical-thinker, and leader.

However, it is important to note that anyone willing to put in the effort can become a Core Member. We will never gate based on how much money you have or how many connections you have. This path is difficult but it is designed to be as fair as possible.

### How to Become a Contributor

In order to become a contributor, you must:

1. Demonstrate your skills by showing us your past work
2. Have a DAO Masons vouch for you skill and reliability (they are ultimately responsible for you and your work)
3. Read and Sign a DAO Masons Contributor Agreement

#### Contributor Details

- Contributors can work on as many DAO Masons projects as they like.
- However, contributors cannot be team leads on projects.
- There is no time limit on how long people can work as contributors. Contributors are free to build and earn as long as they like without any expectations of engaging in Masons governance. However, if a contributor wants to become a Core Member, there is a clear and fair track for doing so.
- There is no pay disparity between core members and contributors.
- Contributors are also free to make contributions to internal projects (DAO Mason Products, DAO upgrades and maintenance, etc.)
- Contributors can receive exposure to the Echo Fund just like Core Members. They only difference is that Contributors receive non-voting shares, whereas Core Members receive voting shares.
- If a contributor becomes a Core Member, their non-voting shares are converted to voting shares.
- All Core Members must be contributors first.

### How to Become a Core Member

- One Core Member must sponsor you for membership
- Contribute to at least 3 completed projects including 1 Internal Project under the contributor track.
- complete the Ritual of Acumen
- complete the Ritual of Oaths
- Afterwards, the DAO must vote to accept you as a Core Member

#### Core Member Details

- Core Members are expected to gather feedback from clients and contributors
- Core Members are expected to participate in all DAO governance meetings and discussions. Of course, there are exceptions for vacations, illness, etc. but Core Members are communicate when they are unable to attend.
- There must be one Core Member leading every project. A team lead is responsible for the outcome and making final decisions on that project. However, a team lead can also delegate some management responsibilities to Contributors with management roles (ex. Project Manager)
- Core Members vote on which projects DAO Masons should work on, how to manage finances, and how to make changes to the DAO rules, culture documents, and governance mechanics, etc.
