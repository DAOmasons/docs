## How to hire us

We would like to provide your DAO with a white-glove service that meets your specific needs. Here's how you can hire us:

- Initial Consultation: We will arrange a convenient voice or video meeting with you to discuss your project requirements and what solutions we can offer.

- Offer Sheet: Based on our meeting, we will prepare an offer sheet that clearly outlines the services we will provide, cost estimate, and an estimated timeline for completion. Together with you, we may add or subtract items until we reach a mutually agreed upon project agreement.

- Smart Invoice: We use Smart Invoice, a smart contract that provides escrow services for payments, ensuring that everyone is protected. To learn more about Smart Invoice, check out their [docs here](https://docs.smartinvoice.xyz/).

- Trusted Contractors: If your project requires additional resources, we will bring in trusted contractors from our network to minimize wait times.

- Transparent Work: All work we undertake will be of high quality and done transparently. We encourage client involvement as part of our team to ensure that the final output meets your expectations.

Please feel free to contact us at [DAO.Mason@proton.me](mailto:DAO.Mason@proton.me) or by joining our Discord at https://discord.gg/zQYhrUB5Hj if you have any questions or would like to discuss your project requirements further.
