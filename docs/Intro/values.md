# Our Values

**Game Direction**

- Provide some preamble about our values and goals behind them.

### Support Sovereign Communities

A DAO Mason builds and services structures that offer sovereign communities the protection, stability, and freedom to coordinate.

### Productive, Disciplined, Sacrificing

A DAOÂ Mason is productive and disciplined. Our clients entrust us with their money, their businesses, and their livelihoods. When we mess up, miss a deadline, or slow down, it matters. We take that responsibility seriously.

### Craftsmen, not Experts

The term expert implies a 'finished state' of knowledge. True expertise comes from applying knowledge to real-world problems. We do not base our opinions on preconceived notions or political abstractions. Instead we humbly solve problems for our clients, and carry with us the knowledge and tools we gain from each project.

### Building Brick by Brick

We believe in steady, sustainable growth. While the dreams of winning big on the token speculation lottery are alluring, we focus on value-creation first.

### Steel Sharpens Steel

In order for us to create sharp, effective DAOs, DAO Masons itself must be as sharp as possible. We continually upgrade our skills, knowledge, and core technology to ensure that our clients are getting the best possible service.

### Human-Centered Design

We do our best to make the tech fit the needs of the people. A system is not resilient or secure if it is not usable by everyone. DAO Masons prefer systems that are play-tested and iterated on by real people, not just by the developers.

### Games, not Laws

DAOs are distinct because of their accessible, open, opt-in nature. Which is why we believe that game design is a strong guiding principle for designing DAOs. A well built coordination mechanism should be engaging, fun, and empowering.
