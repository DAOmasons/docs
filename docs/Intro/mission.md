# Our mission is to help DAOs win.

#### <span style={{color:'white'}}>This is the age of the DAO.</span>

Extraordinary technology, self-sovereign coordination practices, decentralized governance structures - when pieced together properly, human potential becomes unleashed. DAO Masons is committed to making that happen as many times as possible.

Big dreams need great teams. We see a future where everybody understands and has access to the modern tools, practices and support needed to make those dreams into reality.

When that happens, DAOs win. And when DAOs win, we all win.

## Our Principles

### Support Sovereign Communities

A DAO Mason builds and services structures that offer sovereign communities the protection, stability, and freedom to coordinate.

Just as the fortress offered protection and stability to ancient community, we build DAO structures that provide structure and order for modern organizations.

### Productive, Disciplined, Sacrificing

A DAOÂ Mason is productive and disciplined. Voluntary, coordinated sacrifice for virtuous ideals is the blade we use to sever the head of Moloch.

Our clients entrust us with their money, their businesses, and their livelihoods. When we mess up, miss a deadline, or slow down, it matters. We take that responsibility seriously.

### Craftsmen, not Experts

The term expert implies a 'finished state' of knowledge. True expertise comes from a lifetime of applying knowledge to real-world problems. We do not base our opinions on preconceived notions or political abstractions. Instead we humbly solve problems for our clients, and carry with us the knowledge and tools we gain from each project.

### Building Brick by Brick

DAO Masons is bullish slow, sustainable growth. We urge our clients to build slowly and deliberately. While the dreams of winning big on the token speculation lottery are alluring, we advise our clients (and ourselves) to focus on value-creation first.

### Steel Sharpens Steel

DAOs are tools, and like all tools, they are only as good as the people who use them. We believe that a sharp community creates sharper DAO coordination mechanisms, and vice versa. This is why DAO Masons works at the human layer as well as the tech layer.

Also, in order for us to create sharp, effective DAOs, DAO Masons itself must be as sharp as possible. We continually upgrade our skills, knowledge, and core technology to ensure that our clients are getting the best possible service.

### Human-Centered Design

We do our best to make the tech fit the needs of the people. A system is not resilient or secure if it is not usable by everyone. DAO Masons prefer systems that are play-tested and iterated on by real people, not just by the developers.

### Games, not Laws

DAOs are distinct because of their accessible, open, opt-in nature. Which is why we believe that game design is a better, more adaptive model than the punitive, coercive models traditionally found in law.

This doesn't mean that DAOs should not interface with a legal system. But the main layer that DAO members interact should be more game-like. A well built coordination mechanism should be engaging, fun, and empowering.
