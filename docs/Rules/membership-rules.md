# Membership Rules

As outlined in the [Join DAO Masons](/Intro/join) page, there are two distinct paths for contributors to work with DAO Masons:

## Contributor

Contributors are focused primarily on building cool projects and earning. They are not committed to DAO Masons governance.

- Contributors can work on as many DAO Masons projects as they like.
- However, contributors cannot be team leads on projects.
- There is no time limit on how long people can work as contributors. Contributors are free to build and earn as long as they like without any expectations of engaging in Masons governance. However, if a contributor wants to become a Core Member, there is a clear and fair track for doing so.
- There is no pay disparity between core members and contributors.
- Contributors are also free to make contributions to internal projects (DAO Mason Products, DAO upgrades and maintenance, etc.)
- Contributors can receive exposure to the Echo Fund just like Core Members. They only difference is that Contributors receive non-voting shares, whereas Core Members receive voting shares.
- If a contributor becomes a Core Member, their non-voting shares are converted to voting shares.
- All Core Members must be contributors first.

### How to Become a Contributor

In order to become a contributor, you must:

1. Demonstrate your skills by showing us your past work
2. Have a DAO Masons vouch for you skill and reliability (they are ultimately responsible for you and your work)
3. Read and Sign a DAO Masons Contributor Agreement

## Core Member

Core Members also work on projects and earn, but they are also deeply committed to DAO Masons governance.

- Core Members are expected to gather feedback from clients and contributors
- Core Members are expected to participate in all DAO governance meetings and discussions. Of course, there are exceptions for vacations, illness, etc. but Core Members are communicate when they are unable to attend.
- There must be one Core Member leading every project. A team lead is responsible for the outcome and making final decisions on that project. However, a team lead can also delegate some management responsibilities to Contributors with management roles (ex. Project Manager)
- Core Members vote on which projects DAO Masons should work on, how to manage finances, and how to make changes to the DAO rules, culture documents, and governance mechanics, etc.

### How to Become a Core Member

1. One Core Member must sponsor you for membership
2. Contribute to at least 3 completed projects including 1 Internal Project under the contributor track.
3. Complete the [Ritual of Acumen](/Rituals/ritual-of-acumen)
4. Complete the [Ritual of Oaths](/Rituals/ritual-of-oaths)
5. Afterwards, the DAO must vote to accept you as a Core Member
