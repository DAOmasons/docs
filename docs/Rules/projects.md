# Projects

## New Projects

New projects can be submitted for approval by any DAO member using the template below. The new Project is voted upon by DAO membership and a majority vote leads to approval.

## Each Project has a lead.

- The Lead is chosen when a Project proposal is approved through a vote.
- Project leads take full responsibility for everything that happens within their own Project.
- The Lead can add and remove people from their team as they see fit.
- The Lead is responsible for handling disputes between team members within their project.
- Leads are responsible for specifying and meeting all output/deadlines within their own division.
- Leads also work, unless their division is so large that they only have to time to work in a managerial capacity.
- Each division has defined roles for every member, even if that role is somewhat elastic.
- The Leader can award bonus stake (eg. for extra work), but must get approval from other DAO Leads. Usually there is an agreed upon \* rate.
