# Projects

## Project Overview

Projects are the primary unit of work within DAO Masons. All compensated work occurs within the context of a Project.

Projects begin with a Project Proposal.

Compensation comes in the form of DAO shares, loot or direct pay.

Any member can create a Project Proposal using the process defined below.

Projects include 1 or more Project Outcomes that define the end results or output of the Project.

Every project has its own DAO to track contributions and compensation.

## Types of Projects: Internal and External

**Internal projects** are designed to improve some aspect of DAO Masons itself. Examples: Set up a CRM, Generate & Publish internal Rulebook.

**External projects** are designed to provide service to an external entity according to external specifications. Examples: Launch a DAO-backed web site that lets Org A track user contributions.

## Project Definition

### Project Parameters

- All projects have 1 or 2 Project Leads
- All projects must include a Payout Schema that describes how contributors will be compensated
- All projects have 1 or more Project Outcomes that define tangible outcomes, ensuring the project has an end state
- All projects must be approved by the Core DAO

### Project Lead

Projects must have a Project Lead and are specified in the Project Proposal.

Project Leads are the final authority on decisions made within a project. Project Leads can be replaced by a majority vote within a Project DAO. Project Leads can be replaced by a DAO Masons majority vote using the Decision Making Process.

Project Leads must adhere to commitments made in the original Project Proposal.

### Payout Schemas

Each project includes a Payout Schema, that defines how compensation is handled within the project. This is decided by the Project Proposer, and reviewed by the DAO. Pay should be fair to contributors, and can include retroactive compensation for work already accomplished.

Payout Schemas must include a minimum 10% cut to the DAO. The DAO has its own Payout Schema for these cuts, the default being 50% to treasury and 50% to the [Ritual of Echoes](/docs/Rituals/ritual-of-echoes) payouts.

### Project Outcomes & Processes

All projects must define 1 or more **Project Outcomes**. An Outcome is defined in a way that makes it clear when it is complete, so projects naturally end when they've achieved all of their defined Outcomes. Projects can also be ended prematurely if the Outcome is deemed unnecessary or infeasible for some reason.

Projects may also define **Recurring Processes** - actions that are expected to be repeated again and again during the lifespan of the Project.

### Creating New Projects

New Projects begin when a member creates a [Project Proposal](/docs/Templates/project-proposal), adds it to the [Discussion Forum](https://commonwealth.im/dao-masons/discussions) and notifies DAO Masons membership in the [DAO Masons Discord](https://discord.gg/FydbKxFnyU).

The item will be added to an upcoming DAO Masons meeting agenda.
DAO Masons Core Members discuss the project request and use the [Decision Making Process](/docs/Rules/decision-making).
If the DAO approves of the new project, a Moloch Proposal will be created to create a new Project DAO for the team.

### Project End

Projects **end** when all of their Outcomes have been reached or by a DAO Masons Decision.
