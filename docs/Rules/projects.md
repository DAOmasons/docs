# Project Overview

* Projects are the **primary unit of work** within DAO Masons. All compensated work occurs within the context of a Project.

* Projects begin with a [Project Proposal](../Templates/project-proposal).

* Any member can create a Project Proposal using the process defined below.

* Projects must include 1 or more Project Outcomes that specify the end results of the project.

* Every project has its own DAO to track contributions and compensation.

### Types of Projects: Internal and External

**Internal projects** are designed to improve some aspect of DAO Masons itself. Examples: Set up a CRM, Generate & Publish internal Rulebook.

**External projects** are designed to provide service to an external entity according to external specifications. Examples: Launch a DAO-backed web site that lets Org A track user contributions.

## Project Definition

Projects are defined by a completed [Project Proposal Template](../Templates/project-proposal) following the guidelines defined in this document.

### Project Parameters

- All projects have 1 Project Lead and an optional backup Project Lead
- All projects must include a Payout Schema that describes how contributors will be compensated
- All projects have 1 or more Project Outcomes that define tangible outcomes, ensuring the project has an end state
- All projects must be approved by the Core DAO
- All projects must have a completed [Project Proposal Template](../Templates/project-proposal)

### Project Lead

* Projects must have a Project Lead that accepts responsibility for the project.
* Project Leads must adhere to commitments made in the original Project Proposal.
* Project Leads are the final authority on decisions made within a project. 
* Project Leads can assign and unassign contributors to Roles within the project. 
* Project Leads can modify Role definitions as needed. 
* Project Leads can be replaced by a DAO Masons majority vote using the Decision Making Process.
* DAO Masons vote to replace a Project Lead may be initiated by a majority vote within project DAO.


### Payout Schemas

Each project includes a Payout Schema. 

The Project Payout Schema: 

* defines how compensation is handled within the project. 
* is defined by the Project Proposer and is reviewed by the DAO. 
* should be be fair to contributors, and can include retroactive compensation for work already accomplished leading up to project start.
* must include a minimum 10% cut to the DAO, which is used in the [Ritual of Echoes](/docs/Rituals/ritual-of-echoes).


### Project Outcomes & Processes

All projects must define 1 or more **Project Outcomes**. An Outcome is defined in a way that makes it clear when it is complete, so projects naturally end when they've achieved all of their defined Outcomes. Projects can also be ended prematurely by a DAO Masons or Project team vote if the Outcome is deemed unnecessary or infeasible for some reason.

Projects may also define **Recurring Processes** - actions that are expected to be repeated again and again during the lifespan of the Project.

### Creating New Projects

The process for creating a new project is described on the [How to Start a New DAO Masons Project](/docs/Templates/project-proposal) page.

### Project End

Projects end when all of their Outcomes have been reached, by a DAO Masons Decision or on the specified end date of the project.
