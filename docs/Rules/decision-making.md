# How We Make Decisions

## Who Decides?

- Core Members make [Core DAO](docs/Rules/core-dao) decisions through Moloch DAO [Proposals](docs/Rules/proposals)
- Project Leads make [Project](docs/Rules/projects) decisions though a mix of soft consensus, voting within their Project DAO, or not voting at all.
  - In projects, whether or not a decision is made through soft consensus or voting is determined by the Project Lead.
  - Project leads can also choose to not vote on decisions altogether, even if there is a disagreement.
  - However, the team may motion to replace a project lead if necessary.
  - Whether or not a project lead is replaced is determined by the Core DAO after arbitration.

## What does the Core DAO decide on?

The Core DAO makes decisions that fall withing the Core DAO scope. This includes:

- **Projects**. What client work the DAO agrees to take on as well as internal projects.
  - This includes examining who is working on the project, what the project is, what the project is worth, and who the team lead will be. - This is all summarized in a [Project Request](docs/Templates/project-proposal) that is submitted prior to the meeting.
  - DAO Members are expected to have reviewed the Project Proposal before the meeting.
- **Promotions**. Promoting Contributors to Core Members.
  - [A Promotion Request](docs/Templates/promotion-request) should be submitted prior to the meeting.
  - The DAO decides whether or not the member in question meets the [promotion criteria](docs/Rules/dao-structure).
  - DAO Members are expected to have reviewed the Promotion Request before the meeting.
- **Demotions** Demoting Core Members to Contributors.
  - [A Demotion Request](docs/Templates/promotion-request) should be submitted prior to the meeting.
  - The DAO reviews the member in question and makes sure that they member in contract meets the [demotion criteria](docs/Rules/dao-structure).
  - DAO Members are expected to have reviewed the Demotion Request before the meeting.
- **Core DAO Structure**. Changes to the Core DAO structure.
  - This includes changes to any of the DAO rules or operating procedures.
  - Also includes changes to any cultural docs or articles that DAO Masons chooses to publish.
- **Misc** Sometimes the DAO needs to perform actions that are not covered by the above categories.
  - Extra details about these decisions need to be outlined before the Core Masons Meeting, but they need not conform to any particular request template.

## What does a Project DAO decide on?

Any and all decisions regarding within the project scope. Most, if not all cases, the project lead should be the one making decisions for the project. These decisions would include:

- Scope of the project
- Changing roles within the project
- Bring on new members
- Removing members
- Any changes the client requests
- Arbitrating disputes between non-team lead members

## Core DAO Decision Making Process

### For Non-Emergency Decisions

- Core Members meet for weekly Core DAO Masons meetings.
- Items are added to the meeting agenda throughout the week prior.
- Core Members are expected to have reviewed the agenda before the meeting.
- Core Members are expected to have reviewed any items that are being voted on before the meeting.
- Items in the agenda are ordered by priority and time sensitivity.
- Core members discuss each item in the agenda as time permits.
- If there is soft consensus on an item, the DAO makes a Moloch Proposal and votes it through.
- As a general rule, any proposal that has not followed the decision making process should be voted down.

### Deeper Discussions and Disagreements

- If the DAO does not fully agree on an item, or the subject requires further exploration, a member can request that we create a discussion thread on the DAO's forum. This is known as a **Discussion Period**.
- All Discussion Periods have a deadline (usually 1 week)
- The DAO can extend the discussion deadline if there is soft consensus to do so.
- If the DAO finds a compromise by the end of the deadline, the DAO makes a Moloch Proposal with any new changes applied, and votes it through.
- If there is still disagreement, a member can request a **Resolution Meeting** to discuss the item. This meeting should not be the Weekly Core DAO Masons meeting. It should be a meeting that is called specifically for this decision. All Core Members should attend.
- If there is still disagreement after this meeting, the DAO can choose to continue to schedule **Resolution Meetings** until a compromise is reached. They should only do this if there is soft consensus to do so.
- However, after the first **Resolution Meeting**, any Core Member can elect to force a decision by creating a Moloch Proposal. This is meant to safeguard against the DAO getting stuck in governance/meeting hell.
- Resolution Meetings should only be used for decisions that are non-time sensitive and complex in nature. We expect the DAO to able make most decisions quickly.

### Red Alerts/Emergency Decisions

- Any Core Member can raise a Red Alert if they feel that a decision needs to be made immediately (ex, in the case of an attack or exploit)
- Every Core Member is required to have a contact method that guarantees a response within 12 hours.
- Every Core Member is required to delegate their shares to another member in cases where they will be away from their computer for an extended period of time (ex, vacation).
- A meeting will be scheduled within 12 hours of the Red Alert being raised. All non-delegated Core Members are required to attend regardless of whether or not they think the issue is urgent.
- The meeting is not over until the issue is resolved or an action plan is initiated.
- In the case of attack, all DAO operations are suspended and all Core members are required to focus on resolving the issue.
- Once the issue is resolved, the DAO can resume normal operations.
- If a member feels that another member has abused the Red Alert system, the DAO can vote to demote the member in question.

### Governance Backlog

- To ensure timely decision turnaround times for our clients, project proposals should sit first in the agenda for the Core Masons Meeting.
- If there are any project proposals in backlog, Core Masons need to schedules meetings until they are all cleared.
- If the DAO has a large backlog of non-project decisions to make, they should schedule more Core Masons meetings until the backlog is cleared.
- If this happens frequently, the DAO should assess the Core Mason Meeting process and evaluate its overall efficiency, and make changes where needed.
- At no point should any decisions be allowed to sit in the backlog for more than 2 weeks without being addressed.
