# Proposal Process for DAO Masons

All proposals require a Core Member to sponsor. As this is a Moloch DAO, it is possible for anybody to make a proposal, only members my bring a proposal forward for a vote.

## Project Proposals

1. Consensus during meetings
   - For project proposals, we should be able to decide whether to move forward by consensus during our meetings.
   - If consensus is not reached, move onto the forum post stage.
2. Forum post stage
   - For undecided proposals, a detailed forum post should be placed in our [Governance Forums](https://commonwealth.im/dao-masons/discussions). Discussion period will last for 1 week.
   - After it moves past that, and even with consensus, record of the decision must be carried out as a DAO vote.
   - Project proposals will follow a certain form, which is available in the templates section of this guide.
3. Proposal length
   - Proposals length is 5 days with a 3 day grace period, which allows a member 3 days to Rage Quit before a proposal is executed, should they choose to do so.
4. Passing Project proposals will either begin immediately or placed on the schedule.

## Member Proposals

1. Complete Join DAO Masons Guide
   - All member proposals must have completed the steps found in the join DAO Masons guide.
2. Discussion before proposal
   - In almost all cases, some form of discussion should take place before a proposal is made.
3. Proposal on chain
   - A proposal must be placed on chain and requires a core member sponsorship.
4. Proposal length
   - Proposals length is 5 days with a 3 day grace period, which allows a member 3 days to Rage Quit before a proposal is executed, should they choose to do so.

## Governace and Operations Proposals

These types of proposals are generally only made by core members, however there may be times when fresh eyes see opprtunities to improve our Governance and Operations and we certainly welcome proposals to do so.

1. Consensus during meetings
   - For Gov and Ops proposals, we should be able to decide whether to move forward by consensus during our meetings.
   - If consensus is not reached, move onto the forum post stage.
   - Any major governance changes or fundemental changes to operating procedures should have a written long form discussion in our governance forums.
   - Most small expenses can be agreed upon via consensus however any sums that would be considered somewhat large, should be recored in the governance forums. This can be determined during meetings.
2. Forum post stage
   - A detailed forum post should be placed in our [Governance Forums](https://commonwealth.im/dao-masons/discussions). Discussion period will last for 1 week.
   - After this time for discussion has passed, record of the decision must be carried out as a DAO vote.
3. Proposal length
   - Proposals length is 5 days with a 3 day grace period, which allows a member 3 days to Rage Quit before a proposal is executed, should they choose to do so.

## Rage Quit

As is the case in all Moloch DAOs, a member may Rage Quit during the Grace Period. This will convert the members shares into their fair share of tokens in the main treasury. Funds in Project Treasury or otherwise already allocted are not subject to Rage Quit.
Rage Quit is not an option if you currently have "Yes" votes that have not been executed yet.
