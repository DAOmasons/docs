# Core DAO vs. Project DAOs

## Core DAO

The Core DAO is the main DAO that is responsible for the overall governance and direction of the DAO Masons. They are responsible for managing:

- Treasury
- Brand
- Rules and operating procedure
- Project DAOs
- Membership (Promotions, Demotions, etc.)

Only [Core Members](/Rules/membership-rules#core-member) can make decisions for the Core DAO, and they are beholden to a strict [code of conduct](/Rules/decision-making#core-dao-decision-making-process) to make sure that these decisions are made quickly and soundly.

## Project DAOs

For every project that the DAO Masons takes on, a Project DAO is created. These projects include work we take on for clients, internal projects for DAO Masons, and even ongoing operations within DAO Masons

Project DAOs are created by passing a [Project Proposal](/Templates/project-proposal) through the Core DAO. Every project had a team lead that is ultimately responsible for the project's success. Both [Core Members](/Rules/membership-rules#core-member) and [Contributors](/Rules/membership-rules#contributor) can participate in Project DAOs.

Project DAOs are designed to be stream-lined and efficient as possible. For that reason, we've chosen to delegate much of the project-scoped [decision making](/Rules/decision-making#what-does-a-project-dao-decide-on) power to the Project Lead.
