# DAO Roles

Roles at DAO Masons represent a number of different things. In the discord server, roles are similar to roles you would find in many servers, often times developed around interest topics that a visitor may be have. Roles can be fluid in the server will come and go. A good example of this would be with Client Roles and Project Roles that go along with that. We find it is easier and creates less clutter in a server if certain conversations are gated to only those that would need to see as a client or as a member of the team. The following is a breakdown of the role structure at DAO Masons.

## DAO Member Roles

Some roles within the DAO can only be achieved by joining the DAO. The only way to join the DAO is by being a contributor.

## Contributor Roles (Reputation)

Contributor roles are given to people who add value to the DAO in some way, weather it be through taking part in projects or being a good community member. People in contributor roles are often making steps towards becoming full DAO Masons. We have built into our DAO, a reputation system which allows contributors to build the reputation they need in order to gain full membership. This is represented as a role on the Discord server and may include other symbols of your commitment, such as a Soul Bound Token.

## Project Roles

These are very important roles and play a key part in how our DAO is structured. We always work with a project mentality, which we feel is an efficient way to get things done. Every project will have a number of different roles that are required to be filled, in order to complete the projects.

Every project has a project lead. This role is of vital importance as this is often the person that is keeping the entire project on task. Luckily at DAO Masons we have a number of people that are able to fill a project lead role at any given time and we look forward to having more leaders join our team.
Since we develop DAO products, obviously we would need developer roles, account manager roles, designers, etc. All the things that are required to ship a software product and provide the services that we offer.

## Discord Roles

Roles within Discord often follow much of what has already been talked about in this document, in fact those DAO and contributor roles usually coincide with Discord roles. There are a few addition roles in the server which are important to note. For example, all of our bots are given a role, so that they appear nice and orderly on the right menu bar. Another one is #verified. This means that you are verified as human and do not mean any harm to the server.
