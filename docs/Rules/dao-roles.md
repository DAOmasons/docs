# DAO Roles

Roles in the DAO are used in a number of important ways.

## Community Roles

These are roles that are used to "sort" the community in our Discord server. This may include things such as "admin" or "DAO Mason." Roles of this nature may provide access control to parts of the server. This is especially useful in order to have access controlled Client communications. Other roles considered Community Roles, may include Reaction Roles in the server which a visitor may use in order to keep the server uncluttered and only view the areas that interest them.

Community Roles are very flexible and some may come and go depending on needs. Some "sub categories may include:

- DAO Member Roles: Roles that only members of the DAO have.
- Reputaional Roles: Roles that contributors to the DAO may achieve. Example would be roles acheived for completing a project and what role was played in that project. More info about this can be found in the #Badges section.
- Client Roles: These are roles given to clients to provide them a walled garden of conversation about their project.

## Project Roles

These are important roles within DAO Masons as they represent how we "get things done." Project roles define who is responsible to complete tasks in a project, eg. The project "Lead Devoloper" is responsible for development choices in a project. A "Project Lead" is responsible for deciding on the required roles for a project and ensuring those roles are filled. One person may hold multiple roles if required.
