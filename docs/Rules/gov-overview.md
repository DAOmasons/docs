# Governance Overview

DAO Masons is a decentralized organization focused on building DAO products and offering DAO-related services. Our approach to governance emphasizes efficiency, collaboration, and adaptability. This document outlines our governance structure and how we manage decision-making within the organization.

## Two-Tiered Governance

Our governance is structured into two tiers: the Core DAO and Project DAOs. The Core DAO is responsible for overall governance, while Project DAOs are created for each individual project. This structure ensures that decision-making power is distributed and encourages both autonomy and collaboration.

## Membership Roles

DAO Masons offers two distinct membership roles: Contributors and Core Members. Contributors focus on working on projects and earning, while Core Members take on additional responsibilities, such as participating in governance and leading projects. This membership structure allows for clear progression and recognition of talent and commitment.

## Efficient Decision-Making

Both Core Members and Contributors are encouraged to collaborate on projects, share their expertise, and contribute to the growth of the organization. This inclusive environment ensures that diverse perspectives are heard and valued, ultimately leading to better decision-making and more successful projects.

## Contribution-Based Governance

Contribution-based governance is a fundamental principle at DAO Masons. We believe that the people who contribute the most to the DAO should have the most say in its governance. By only offering shares to those who have made contributions, we ensure that the organization is run by those who are most invested in its success.
